> Picture this: you’re scrolling on your phone, stuck in a rut on a Saturday afternoon. There’s just nothing better to do. Or is there? Enter Spur. An all-in-one activity manager that turns your scrolling into: birdwatching, painting, pickleball, or any of the other activities we help you find and plan. Rally your friends, ditch your phone, and be of the moment, with Spur!

# To Run

To run this app, you must have a computer with command line access and a mobile device with Expo Go installed.

1. Download the repo using `git clone https://github.com/simrantan/spur-app.git`
2. `cd spur-app` and run `npm i`
3. Start the development server using `npx expo start`
4. Scan the QR code provided in the terminal. This will open the app in Expo Go on your phone!

We tried to deploy using `eas` (Expo Application Service), which generated this QR code. However, the eas deployment gave us un-debuggable issues, whereas local deployment works more consistently.
